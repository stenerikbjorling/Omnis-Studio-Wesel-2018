Connection information test site - DVDRental example

The web-based deployments of the DVDRental example residing on Enviro Data server can be accessed by desktop / mobile browsers and by Omnis App for iOS and Android.

Connection info for desktop / mobile browsers:

http://envirodata.se/testapp

Via Omnis App for iOS and Android:

Name: DVDRental Test
Host Server: http://envirodata.se
Online form URL: /testapp?

Caveats:

Not beautified! Remember this!
Some quirks in the event management in the mobile version - sometimes you have to click lists to update linked elements properly.

You start with optionally specifying a search term and press search - then choose actors in the result list. The sales stats tab involves a 7-table join. Note the performance. By choosing the graphical presentation you see the distribution in an pie chart.

Issues found, critics and suggestions highly welcome. This system is running on a server with large number of connections for testing until August. Kindly perform eventual tests before end of August.

Take care, all the best...
