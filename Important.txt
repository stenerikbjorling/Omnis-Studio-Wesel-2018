Important!

The DVDRental_2018 example covers the use of SQL workers in combination with support for multiple workers in windows / remote forms/ subforms and example of a remote form designed for parallel deployment for desktop and mobile devices.

The example have hardcoded session pools in the Startup task for SQLite with a session pool connected to a Postgres server at Enviro Data for sales analysis. The attached files contains a dump file for Postgres - if you want to use this databaser then each of the data and process objects must have their worker object names assigned to the Postgres worker object name - done in the class variable definition pane.

The current example do not contain a functional demonstration of sql worker support for REST services - work in progress, and the overall solution is only optimised at a basic level. Still quite good performance.

Good luck and hack away...
